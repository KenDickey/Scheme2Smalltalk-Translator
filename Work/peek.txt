I think I have a copy lying around that I downloaded in the last few
months. Remind me again in a few days when things have settled down.

Class ref-name: FileStream
{
    Method [
    peek
        |size := readLimit(). position := position|
        ^(position >= size) ifTrue: [nil] ifFalse: [
            |ch| := next(1). position(position). ch
        ].
    ]
}

Try the above? (I just wrote it but haven't had time to test it)
